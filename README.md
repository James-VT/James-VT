### Welcome!

Not many commits to see here at present - most of my code has either been for work, or solo with no current need to push. Recent (and by recent I mean April 2025) work has been on getting my old projects running again, by combing through error logs on Render and bringing MongoDB back to life. I've also been focussing on my cloud work (now certified for AWS cloud as of early April) but you won't see any of that here because £££.
