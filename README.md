### Welcome!

What I love about GitHub is that I can have all my bits and pieces and half-finished projects in one place, and it'll still look tidier than my desk.

I am currently working on a couple of things. One project with Python, and another with JavaScript.

With Python, I am currently learning NumPy and Pandas.

With JavaScript, I am currently building a meat cooking calculator.
