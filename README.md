### Welcome!

What I love about GitHub is that I can have all my bits and pieces and half-finished projects in one place, and it'll still look tidier than a physical workbench used in the same way.

I'm currently going back to basics on Python, making sure I've nailed some very simple functionality like data type manipulation. As you can see from my repos and my pinned projects, I've already worked with it and even built two working projects (one with Flask, one with Django) but I want to make sure I don't get rusty while learning other things.

What do I mean by other things?

I'm currently getting to grips with VSCode, having used only Gitpod up to this point. I am using VSCode as the IDE to build my current project, which is a calculator for cooking meat. This serves both as a way to learn to use VSCode and get some more practice with JavaScript.
