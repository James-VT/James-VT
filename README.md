### Welcome!

What I love about GitHub is that I can have all my bits and pieces and half-finished projects in one place, and it'll still look tidier than my desk.

Now that I have landed a job as a software engineer, my personal commit history is looking very thin. I've recently re-picked up one of my projects, however: my meat calculator. This is a JavaScript project, and my current goal is to integrate TypeScript into this to some degree. My hobby-coding is mostly restricted to weekends now, or the occasional train journey/coffee stop during the week.
