### Welcome!

What I love about GitHub is that I can have all my bits and pieces and half-finished projects in one place, and it'll still look tidier than a physical workbench or desk treated in the same way.

Currently most of my Python work is being done on various challenges, such as leetcode and codesignal. As you can see from my repos and my pinned projects, I've already worked with it and even built two working projects (one with Flask, one with Django) but I want to make sure I don't get rusty while learning other things. So even if you're not seeing much Python here, I'm still using it.

So what am I doing that you can see here?

I'm currently getting to grips with VSCode, having used only Gitpod up to this point. I am using VSCode as the IDE to build my current project, which is a calculator for cooking different cuts of meat. This serves both as a way to learn to use VSCode and get some more practice with raw JavaScript.
